    <!-- <center><h1>Who Dares???!!!!</h1> -->

    <!-- <p>Who dares defile this ancient land? Who dares the wrath of [REDACTED] and the [DATA EXPUNGED].</p> -->

    <p>[REDACTED]: You did it. You won. It's over. You stopped the [REDACTED] and closed the [DATA EXPUNGED]. But it comes at a cost. [REDACTED], [DATA EXPUNGED], this entire operation. 
                    You see I've watched you work. Come to understand your motivation. You think the only way is to [DATA EXPUNGED] them all. Leave nothing behind. And you may be right. But we can't just 
                    shut it all down. Without [REDACTED] it will be worse. I don't expect you to agree. But with this, we can continue our work. I am not the villain in this story. I do what I do because
                    there is no choice. Our time is up. I won't [DATA EXPUNGED] you. But I won't have you standing in our way. 'Til we see each other again.
    </p>
