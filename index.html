    <!-- <center><h1>Who Dares???!!!!</h1> -->

    <!-- <p>Who dares defile this ancient land? Who dares the wrath of [REDACTED] and the [DATA EXPUNGED].</p> -->

    <p>[REDACTED]: You did it you won. It's over. You stopped the [REDACTED]> and closed the [DATA EXPUNGED]. But it comes at a cost. [REDACTED], [DATA EXPUNGED], this entire operation. 
                    You see I've watched you work. Come to understand your motivation. You think the only way is to [DATA EXPUNGED] them all. Leave nothing behind. But we can't just 
                    shut it all down. Without [REDACTED] it will be worse.
